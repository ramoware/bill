{
  id: timestamp,
  name: "Customer Name",
  amount: 1000.50,
  date: "2024-01-15",
  paymentMode: "Bank Transfer",
  // ... payment-specific fields
  notes: "Additional information"
}
```

- Clearing browser data will remove all transactions
- Regular exports are recommended for backup

- No data is sent to external servers
- Suitable for personal and small business use

### Limitations
- Single-user application
- Browser storage limits apply (typically 5-10MB)
- No cloud synchronization

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Data not saving** - Check if localStorage is enabled in browser
2. **Form not submitting** - Ensure all required fields are filled
3. **Print layout broken** - Use the dedicated print button

### Clearing Application Data
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.removeItem('sun-enterprises-transactions');
localStorage.removeItem('darkMode');
```
